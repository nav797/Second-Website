<h1>WFA - Work From Anywhere</h1>

Welcome to the WFA project! This is a responsive website page designed using HTML and Tailwind CSS. This site also implements a few lines of JavaScript to enable scroll-reveal animations. My goal for this project was to learn and gain experience with Tailwind CSS. While I had prior experience with HTML and CSS, I discovered that Tailwind offers a more efficient way to apply styles to a website. Throughout the process of creating this site, I learned what Tailwind is and how to effectively implement it.
